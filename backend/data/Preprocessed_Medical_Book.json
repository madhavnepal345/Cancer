Gourley Abortion, spontaneous see Miscarriage Abortion, therapeutic Definition Therapeutic abortion is the intentional termination of a pregnancy before the fetus can live independently. Abortion has been a legal procedure in the United States since 1973. Purpose An abortion may be performed whenever there is some compelling reason to end a pregnancy. Women have abortions because continuing the pregnancy would cause them hardship, endanger their life or health, or because prenatal testing has shown that the fetus will be born with severe abnormalities.",

The disorder appears in approximately one in every 10,000 births. Achondroplasia is usually diagnosed at birth, owing to the characteristic appearance of the newborn. Normal bone growth depends on the production of cartilage a fibrous connective tissue . Over time, calcium is deposited within the cartilage, causing it to harden and become bone.",

Nearly all of the forms of Oriental medicine which are used in the West today, including acupuncture, shiatsu, acupressure massage, and macrobiotics, are part of or have their roots in Chinese medicine.

In the early 1900s, only a few Western physicians who had visited China were fascinated by acupuncture, but outside of Asian-American communities it remained virtually unknown until the 1970s, when Richard Nixon became the first U.S. president to visit China. On Nixon’s trip, journalists were amazed to observe major operations being performed on patients without the use of anesthetics. Instead, wide-awake patients were being operated on with only acupuncture needles inserted into them to control pain.

    "text": "In AIDS, immunodeficiency results from the way that the virus binds to a protein called CD4, which is primarily found on the surface of certain subtypes of white blood cells called helper T cells or CD4 cells. After the virus has attached to the CD4 receptor, the virus-CD4 complex refolds to uncover another receptor called a chemokine receptor that helps to mediate entry of the virus into the cell. One chemokine receptor in particular, CCR5, has gotten recent attention after studies showed that defects in its structure caused by genetic mutations cause the progression of AIDS to be prevented or slowed. Scientists hope that this discovery will lead to the development of drugs that trigger an artificial mutation of the CCR5 gene or target the CCR5 receptor. Once HIV has entered the cell, it can replicate intracellularly and kill the cell in ways that are still not completely understood.",

In order to understand the different purposes of the blood tests used with AIDS patients, it is helpful to understand how HIV infection affects human blood and the immune system. HIV is a retrovirus that enters the blood stream of a new host in the following ways: • by sexual contact • by contact with infected body fluids such as blood and urine • by transmission during pregnancy, or • through transfusion of infected blood products A retrovirus is a virus that contains a unique enzyme called reverse transcriptase that allows it to replicate within new host cells.

Some therapists believe that family members, in an effort to deal with their loved one’s drinking problem, sometimes develop patterns of behavior that accidentally support or “enable” the patient’s drinking. This situation is referred to as “co-dependence,” and must be addressed in order to successfully treat a person’s alcoholism. Sessions led by peers, where recovering alcoholics meet regularly and provide support for each other’s recoveries, are considered some of the best methods of preventing a return to drinking relapse . Perhaps the most well-known such group is called Alcoholics Anonymous, which uses a “12-step” model to help people avoid drinking.",

Nikolaas Tinbergen, in his 1973 Nobel lecture, hailed the “striking improvements in such diverse things as high blood pressure, breathing, depth of sleep, overall cheerfulness and mental alertness, resilience against outside pressures, and the refined skill of playing a musical instrument.” He went on to quote a list of other conditions helped by the Alexander technique: “rheumatism, including various forms of arthritis, then respiratory troubles, and even potentially lethal asthma; following in their wake, circulation defects, which may lead to high blood pressure and also to some dangerous heart conditions; gastrointestinal disorders of many types, various gynecological conditions, sexual failures, migraines and depressive states.” Literature in the 1980s and 1990s went on to include improvements in back pain, chronic pain, postural probGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 Alexander technique --- Page 118 --lems, repetitive strain injury, benefits during pregnancy and childbirth, help in applying physical therapy and rehabilitative exercises, improvements in strain caused by computer use, improvements in the posture and performance of school children, and improvements in vocal and dramatic performance among the benefits offered by the technique. Description Origins Frederick Matthias Alexander was born in 1869 in Tasmania, Australia. He became an actor and Shakespearean reciter, and early in his career he began to suffer from strain on his vocal chords. He sought medical attention for chronic hoarseness, but after treatment with a recommended prescription and extensive periods of rest, his problem persisted.",

    "text": "Alexander realized that his hoarseness began about an hour into a dramatic performance and reasoned that it was something he did in the process of reciting that caused him to lose his voice. Returning to his medical doctor, Alexander told him of his observation. When the doctor admitted that he didn’t know what Alexander was doing to injure his vocal chords, Alexander decided to try and find out for himself. Thus began a decade of self-observation and discovery. Using as many as three mirrors to observe himself in the act of reciting, normal speaking, and later standing, walking, and sitting, Alexander managed to improve his coordination and to overcome his vocal problems.",

After making this discovery at the end of the nineteenth century, Alexander became a pioneer in body-mind medicine. At first, performers and dancers sought guidance from Alexander to overcome physical complaints and to improve the expression and spontaneity of their performances. Soon a great number of people sought help from his teaching for a variety of physical and mental disorders. The Alexander technique is primarily taught oneon-one in private lessons.",

Laboratory tests The laboratory tests that are done to obtain this information include a complete blood count CBC , a sputum culture, a blood serum test of IgE levels, and a skin test for the Aspergillus antigen. In the skin test, a small amount of antigen is injected into the upper layer of skin on the patient’s forearm about four inches below the elbow.

If neither parent has allergies, the chances of a child developing allergy is approximately 10-20%; if one parent has allergies, it is 30-50%; and if both have allergies, it is 40-75%.One source of this genetic predisposition is in the ability to produce higher levels of IgE in response to allergens.",

Description A person with AD usually has a gradual decline in mental functions, often beginning with slight memory loss, followed by losses in the ability to maintain employment, to plan and execute familiar tasks, and to reason and exercise judgment. Communication ability, mood, and personality may also be affected. Most people who have AD die within eight years of their diagnosis, although that interval may be as short as one year or as long as 20 years. AD is the fourth leading cause of death in adults after heart disease, cancer, and stroke.",

During their life cycles, the amebas exist in two very different forms: the infective cyst or capsuled form, which cannot move but can survive outside the human body because of its protective covering, and the disease-producing form, the trophozoite, which although capable of moving, cannot survive once excreted in the feces and, therefore, cannot infect others. The disease is most commonly transmitted when a person eats food or drinks water containing E. histolytica cysts from human feces. In the digestive tract the cysts are transported to the intestine where the walls of the cysts are broken open by digestive secretions, releasing the mobile trophozoites. Once released within the intestine, the trophozoites multiply by feeding on intestinal bacteria or by invading the lining of the large intestine.",

A sample of the amniotic fluid, which surrounds a fetus in the womb, is collected through a pregnant woman’s abdomen using a needle and syringe. Tests performed on fetal cells found in the sample can reveal the presence of many types of genetic disorders, thus allowing doctors and prospective parents to make important decisions about early treatment and intervention.

It is also recommended for women who have already borne children with birth defects, or when either of the parents has a family history of a birth defect for which a diagnostic test is available. Another reason for the procedure is to confirm indications of Down syndrome and certain other defects which may have shown up previously during routine maternal blood screening.

Various other tests, including blood and urine tests, x rays, and CT scans, may be done to rule out other possible causes of the symptoms, such as tumors of the skull base or high cervical spinal cord, thyroid disease, spinal arthritis, lead poisoning, or severe vitamin deficiency.",

In low anal atresia, the channel may open in front of the circular mass of muscles that constrict to close the anal opening anal sphincter or, in boys, below the scrotum.

Although pain syndromes may be dissimilar, the common factor is a sensory pathway from the affected organ to the brain.

Selection of an appropriate analgesic is based on consideration of the risk-benefit factors of each class of drugs, based on type of pain, severity of pain, and risk of adverse effects. Traditionally, pain has been divided into two classes, acute and chronic, although severity and projected patient survival are other factors that must be considered in drug selection.",

Side effects include nausea and vomiting upon awakening. • Opioids include fentanyl, sufentanil, and alfentanil, and are frequently used prior to anesthesia and surgery as a sedative and analgesic, as well as a continuous infusion for primary anesthesia. Because opioids rarely affect the cardiovascular system, they are particularly useful for cardiac surgery and other high-risk cases. Opioids act directly on spinal cord receptors, and are freqently used in epidurals for spinal anesthesia.",

Also, propofol is rapidly metabolized in the liver and excreted in the urine, so it can be used for long durations of anesthesia, unlike thiopental.

There are various types of these procedures and their names are associated with the type of vessel entry and equipment used. For example, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty PTA describes entry through the skin percutaneous and navigates to the area of the vessel of interest through the same vessel or one that communicates with it transluminal . In the case of a procedure involving the coronary arteries, the point of entry could be the femoral artery in the groin and the catheter/guidewire system is passed through the aorta to the heart and the origin of the coronary arteries at the base of the aorta just outside the aortic valve.",

This narrowing may occur in any vessel but may occur anywhere. Once the vessel has been widened, adequate blood flow is returned. The vessel may narrow again over time at the same location and the procedure could be repeated.

Lohr, PhD Anorectal fistula see Anorectal disorders Anorexia nervosa Definition Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by unrealistic fear of weight gain, self-starvation, and conspicuous distortion of body image. The name comes from two Latin words that mean nervous inability to eat. In females who have begun to menstruate, anorexia nervosa is usually marked by amenorrhea, or skipping at least three menstrual periods in a row. The fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or DSM-IV 1994 , defines two subtypes of anorexia nervosa—a restricting type, characterized by strict dieting and exercise without binge eating; and a binge-eating/purging type, marked by episodes of compulsive eating with or without self-induced vomiting and the use of laxatives or enemas. DSM-IV defines a binge as a time-limited usually under two hours episode of compulsive eating in which the individual consumes a significantly larger amount of food than most people would eat in similar circumstances.",

In current use, the benzodiazepines, the best known class of anxiolytics, have been largely supplanted by serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors SSRIs, citalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine and others which have a milder side effect profile and less risk of dependency. However, traditional anxiolytics remain useful for patients who need a rapid onset of action, or whose frequency of exposure to anxiety provoking stimuli is low enough to eliminate the need for continued treatment. While SSRIs may require three to five weeks to show any effects, and must be taken continuously, benzodiazepines may produce a response within 30 minutes, and may be dosed on an as-needed basis. The intermediate action benzodiazepines, alprazolam Xanax , and lorazepam Ativan are the appropriate choice for treatment of mild anxiety and social phobia.",

As a class, benzodiazepines are used not only as anxiolytics, but also as sedatives, muscle relaxants, and in treatment of epilepsy and alcoholism. The distinctions between these uses are largely determined by onset and duration of action, and route of administration.

Wounds that are not fresh may need the attention of a physician to prevent complications such as blood poisoning. Topical antibiotics are meant to be used only on the skin and only for only a few days at a time.",

In clinical settings, agoraphobia is usually not a disorder by itself, but is typically associated with some form of panic disorder.",

Description The aorta carries oxygen-rich blood to the body, and is therefore called an artery. Because the aorta is an artery, its walls are made of up three layers; a thin inner layer, a muscular middle layer that gives the vessel its flexibility under pressure from the filling blood , and a fiber-like outer layer that gives the vessel strength to not burst when the heart pumps blood to the body.

This is called a dissecting aneurysm because one layer is “dissected” or separated from another. If damage occurs to only the middle muscular layer of the vessel, a sack-like bulge can form; therefore, this is a saccular aneurysm.

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 Apgar testing As one of very few female medical students at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York during the early 1930s and one of the first women to graduate from its medical school, Apgar knew that her goal of becoming a surgeon would not be achieved easily in a male-dominated profession. Reluctantly, she switched her medical specialty to anesthesiology, she embraced her new field with typical intelligence and energy. At this time, anesthesiology was a relatively new field, having been left by the doctors mostly to the attention of nurses. Apgar realized immediately how much in need of scientifically trained personnel was this significant part of surgery, and she set out to make anesthesiology a separate medical discipline.",

Acquired aplastic anemia can be associated with: • exposure to drugs, especially anti-cancer agents, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory agents, seizure medications, and antithyroid drugs drugs given to stop the functioning of an overactive thyroid • exposure to radiation • chemical exposure especially to the organic solvent benzene and certain insecticides • infection with certain viruses especially those causing viral hepatitis, as well as Epstein-Barr virus, parvovirus, and HIV, the virus which can cause AIDS • pregnancy • certain other disorders, including a disease called paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, an autoimmune reaction called graft-vs-host disease which occurs when the body’s immune system attacks and destroys the body’s own cells , and certain connective tissue diseases Hereditary aplastic anemia is relatively rare, but does occur in Fanconi’s anemia, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, and dyskeratosis congenita. Symptoms of aplastic anemia tend to be those of other anemias, including fatigue, weakness, tiny reddish-purple marks petechiae on the skin evidence of pinpoint hemorrhages into the skin , evidence of abnormal bruising, and bleeding from the gums, nose, intestine, or vagina.",

When this happens, the infected contents of the appendix spill into the abdomen, potentially causing a serious infection of the abdomen called peritonitis.",

A literature review published in 1999 by researchers from the School of Medicine at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the Foundation for Allied Conservative Therapies Research in Chapel Hill stated that, although AK appears to be a promising methodology, there is a lack of research results relevant to clinical practice and outcomes of AK care. They found this lack of results surprising, since cost, satisfaction, utilization, and changes in symptoms are the important results of clinical practice. In addition, they determined that some studies that were supposed to be an evaluation of AK procedures did not actually use clinical practices and principles of AK. However, from studies adhering to AK principles and employing standardized training by well-trained practitioners, they did state there was some evidence that AK is an objectively verifiable phenomenon.",

Damp environments favor large populations of mosquitoes, and thus also increase the risk of arbovirus infections. The major causes of arbovirus encephalitis include the members of the viral families alphavirus causing Eastern equine encephalitis, Western equine encephalitis, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis , flavivirus responsible for St. Louis encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis, Tick-borne encephalitis, Murray Valley encephalitis, Russian spring-summer encephalitis, and Powassan , and bunyavirus causing California encephalitis .

The normal heartbeat starts in the right atrium, where the heart’s natural pacemaker the sinus node sends an electrical signal to the center of the heart to the atrioventricular node. The atrioventricular node then sends signals into the main pumping chamber to make the ventricle contract. Arrhythmias occur when the heartbeat starts in a part of the heart other than the sinus node, an abnormal rate or rhythm develops in the sinus node, or a heart conduction “block” prevents the electrical signal from traveling down the normal pathway. More than four million Americans have arrhythmias, most of which are harmless.",

The three doshas are vata, pitta, and kapha. Each person has a unique blend of the three doshas, known as the person’s prakriti, which is why Ayurvedic treatment is always individualized.

During its life cycle, this organism exists in two very different forms: the infective cyst or capsuled form, which cannot move but can survive outside the human body because of its thick, protective covering; and the disease-producing form, the trophozoite, which although capable of moving, cannot survive once excreted in the feces and, therefore, cannot infect others.

A diagnosis of balantidiasis may be considered when a patient has diarrhea combined with a possible history of recent exposure to amebiasis through travel, contact with infected persons, or anal intercourse. Specifically, a diagnosis of balantidiasis is made by finding B. coli cysts or trophozoites in the patient’s stools or by finding trophozoites in tissue samples biopsy taken from the large bowel.",

Because barbiturates work on the central nervous system, they may add to the effects of alcohol and other drugs that slow the central nervous system, such as antihistamines, cold medicine, allergy medicine, sleep aids, medicine for seizures, tranquilizers, some pain relievers, and muscle relaxants. They may also add to the effects of anesthetics, including those used for dental procedures.

When skin is deprived of oxygen and nutrients for as little as an hour, areas of tissue can die and bedsores can form. Slight rubbing or friction against the skin can cause minor pressure ulcers.

There is no one diagnostic feature of this disease, so diagnosis depends on grouping together enough symptoms in order to identify the disease. Symptoms of Behcet’s syndrome also occur in other diseases, so it is often necessary to rule out the other diseases before a definitive diagnosis can be reached. Treatment Some of the current drugs used to treat Behcet’s syndrome include: • corticosteroids • cyclosporin • azathioprine • chlorambucil • interferon alpha • thalidomide • levamisole • pulse cyclophosphamide • cyclosporine Prognosis The prognosis for Behcet’s syndrome is generally poor.",

The venomous snakes of the United States are divided into two families, the Crotalidae pit vipers and the Elapidae. Pit vipers, named after the small heat-sensing pit that lies between each eye and nostril, are responsible for about 99% of the venomous snakebites suffered by Americans. Rattlesnakes, copperheads, and cottonmouths also called water moccasins are pit vipers. This family of snakes delivers its venom through two long, hinged fangs in the upper jaw.",

Description The risk of having black lung disease is directly related to the amount of dust inhaled over the years; the disease typically affects workers over age 50. Its common name comes from the fact that the inhalation of heavy deposits of coal dust makes miners lungs look black instead of a healthy pink.

The 1969 law also set up a black lung disability benefits program to compensate coal miners who have been disabled by on-the-job dust exposure. Despite the technology available to control the hazard, however, miners still run the risk of developing this lung disease. The risk is much lower today, however; fewer than 10% of coal miners have any x ray evidence of coal dust deposits.",

Diagnosis Bleeding varices may be suspected in a patient who has any of the above-mentioned symptoms, and who has either been diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver or who has a history of prolonged alcohol abuse. The definitive diagnosis is established via a specialized type of endoscopy, namely, esophagogastroduodenoscopy EGD , a procedure that involves the visual examination of the lining of the esophagus, stomach, and upper duodenum with a flexible fiberoptic endoscope. Treatment The objective during treatment of bleeding varices is to stop and/or prevent bleeding and to restore/maintain normal blood circulation throughout the body. Patients with severe bleeding should be treated in intensive care since uncontrolled bleeding can lead to death.",

An instrument, inserted along with the endoscope, is used either to inject these sites with a clotting agent or to tie off the bleeding sites with tiny rubber bands. Repeated endoscopic treatments usually four to six are generally required to eliminate the varices and to prevent the recurrence of bleeding.

If the person needs a blood transfusion, another test called crossmatching is done after the blood is typed to find blood from a donor that the person’s body will accept.

Purpose Bone grafting is used to repair bone fractures that are extremely complex, pose a significant risk to the patient, or fail to heal properly. Bone graft is also used to help fusion between vertebrae, correct deformities, or provide structural support for fractures of the spine. In addition to fracture repair, bone graft is used to repair defects in bone caused by birth defects, traumatic injury, or surgery for bone cancer.",

New bone for grafting can be obtained from other bones in the patient’s own body e.g., hip bones or ribs , called autograft, or from bone taken from other people that is frozen and stored in tissue banks, called allograft. A variety of natural and synthetic replacement materials are also used instead of bone, including collagen the protein substance of the white fibers of the skin, bone, and connective tissues ; polymers, such as silicone and some acrylics; hydroxyapatite; calcium sulfate; and ceramics.

Purpose Bone growth stimulation is done when satisfactory healing is not occurring naturally or when the pace of healing is too slow. This condition is called fracture nonunion, and it occurs more frequently among adults than children, in people with severe or complex fractures, and in people who smoke. The theory behind applying an electric current to fractures to stimulate healing is based on the fact that the concave side of the bone becomes negatively charged and the convex side is positively charged.",

Description The brain is usually well insulated from infection by bacteria, protected by the skull, the meninges tissue layers surrounding the brain , the immune system, and the highly regulated barrier between the bloodstream and the brain. Under certain circumstances, however, bacteria can invade the brain and cause a localized infection called an abscess. Brain abscess is relatively rare, accounting for 1 in 10,000 hospital admissions. Single abscess occurs in 75% of cases, and the remainder of cases involve multiple abscesses.",

The procedure most often performed is a craniotomy, but the goals of any type of brain tumor surgery include: • removing as much of the tumor as possible called debulking the tumor • removing tumor tissue for microscopic analysis • allowing neurosurgeons to see exactly how the tumor is situated and how it is growing • creating an entry channel for chemotherapy drugs and forms of radiation that are implanted in the brain Depending on the type of brain tumor, its location, and its size, a number of different techniques may be used to surgically remove it.",

Examples of abnormality can include a breast lump felt during physical self examination or tissue changes noticed from a mammogram test. Before a biopsy is performed, it is important to make sure that the threat of cancer cannot be disproved or ruled out by a simpler, less invasive examination.

The drug tamoxifen binds up these receptors on the cancer cells so that the hormones can’t have an effect and, in so doing, inhibits tumor growth. If the patient has these receptors present, tamoxifen is commonly prescribed for five years as an adjunct to primary treatment. Adjuvant hormonal therapy with tamoxifen has few side effects but they have to be kept in mind, particularly the need for yearly evaluation of the uterus. Other agents directed at altering hormone environment are under study.",

Shortly after the modified radical mastectomy replaced the radical mastectomy as primary surgical treatment, it was appreciated that survival after local treatment in stage II breast cancer was improved by the addition of chemotherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy for an interval of four to six months is now standard treatment for patients with stage II disease. The addition of systemic therapy to local treatment in patients who have no evidence of disease is performed on the basis that some patients have metastasis that are not currently demonstrable because they are microscopic. By treating the whole patient early, before widespread disease is diagnosed, the adjuvant treatment improves survival rates from roughly 60% for stage II to about 75% at five years after treatment.",

Reconstructions are commonly done after one or both breasts are removed as a treatment for breast cancer. Also, a breast may need to be refashioned for other reasons, such as trauma or abnormalities that occur during breast development.

In humans, brucellosis continues to be spread via unpasteurized milk obtained from infected cows or through contact with the discharges of cattle and goats during miscarriage. In areas of the world where milk is not pasteurized, for example in Latin America and the Mediterranean, the disease is still contracted by ingesting unpasteurized dairy products. However, in the United States, the widespread pasteurization of milk and nearly complete eradication of the infection from cattle has reduced the number of human cases from 6,500 in 1940 to about 70 in 1994.",

In fact, in a recent survey of more than 350 women, nearly 90% wore shoes that were at least one size too small or too narrow. Because genetic factors can predispose people to the hallux valgus bone displacement, a strong family history of bunions can increase the likelihood of developing this foot disorder. Various arthritic conditions and several genetic and neuromuscular diseases, such as Down syndrome and Marfan syndrome, cause muscle imbalances that can create bunions from displacement of the first metatarsal and big toe. Other possible causes of bunions are leg-length discrepancies, with the bunion present on the longer leg, and trauma occurring to the joint of the big toe.",
